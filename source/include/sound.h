     *
     *   - played using `play_sound_effect`,

     *     sound effects).
     *
     * SplashKit will mix the audio from multiple sound effects, making it
     * possible to play multiple `sound_effect`s, or even to play the one
     * `sound_effect` multiple times.
     *
     * You can check if a `sound_effect` is currently playing using
     * `sound_effect_playing`.
     *
     * To stop a `sound_effect` playing use `stop_sound_effect`. This will stop all
     * instances of this one sound effect from playing.
     *
     * Use `music` for background music for your games.
